# Project: Predicting Positive Moves Using Support Vector Machine

## Problem and Methodology
- Produce a model to predict positive moves using the support vector machine.
- Propose detailed feature engineering and model architecture.
- Data load: use 5-year period S&P 500 ETF Trust data, and check columns and missing data.
- Create various features, using pair plots and correlation calculations to decide left ones.
- Try Gaussian kernel.
- Utilize forward-chaining cross-validation method and grid search.


## Results
- Results show via ROC curve and confusion matrix.
- Accuracy is 0.56.
- ROC curve is 0.51.


## Known Issues
- Support vector machine may not be quite suitable to analysis time-series data, since it may not grasp temporal dimension characters.
- Further consideration of feature engineering.
