# Project: the Use of the Monte Carlo Scheme to Price Exotic Options

## Problem and Methodology
- Using the Euler-Maruyama scheme for initially simulating the underlying price paths. 
- Calculating option prices based on initial conditions.
- Option types: Asian Call option(fixed/floating), Lookback Call(maximum/minimum, fixed/floating), Lookback Put(maximum/minimum, fixed/floating)
- Discussing Greeks

## Results
- Asian options show smoothing effects.
- Lookback options show more sensitive to changes of underlying parameters than standard European options.

## Future Work
- Calculate and discuss Greeks under different volatility regimes.
- Consider other methods, such as deriving and using modified BS model adapted to exotic options.
